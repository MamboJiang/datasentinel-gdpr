# DataSentinel GDPR

DataSentinel GDPR is a hackathon project concept for GDPR-relevant data discovery and accountable cleanup workflows.

The project goal is to help an organization identify, classify, route, review, and audit personal-data findings across distributed file sources such as OneDrive, SharePoint, shared drives, and local sample repositories.

This repository is currently initialized for planning and collaboration only. It does not contain production code yet.

## Product Thesis

Find risky personal-data records, explain why they matter, route them to the accountable human, and prove what happened.

## Current Scope

- Maintain English-language project documentation.
- Keep acceptance criteria explicit and reviewable.
- Prepare the repository for collaborative implementation.
- Define a tolerant frontend-backend contract for parallel delivery.
- Avoid speculative architecture, dependencies, or product features before they are accepted.

## Non-Goals

- No automatic deletion of user data without human review.
- No legal advice.
- No production integration with Microsoft 365 or other external systems yet.
- No implementation code before the project requirements and technical approach are approved.
